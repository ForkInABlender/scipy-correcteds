# why this exists:

pybrain3 is a useful, lightweight framework aimed at neural network development and ai development.

The patches to scipy reference numpy 1.26.1 for pybrain3 specification.
As the initial owners halted development in 2008 to 2009, the codebase is not dead yet.

thanks to robertobean on replit and the library's prior maintainers, this library fix will keep the code
 from having missing implementation.
